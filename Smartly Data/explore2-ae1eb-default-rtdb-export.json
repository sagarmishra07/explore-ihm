In the hotel industry, polished presentation is vital to success. Everything about your property will be evaluated through photographs and reviews before a guest even decides to purchase a room. If your rooms look out of date, your lobby is dirty or your restaurant looks cramped, guests will make an initial judgment about your property that will not be in your favor. The same applies to the hotel staff too. They must look professional and presentable because they are an integral part of the property.Now it is very importantly applicable to staff, when it comes to the staff’s demeanor, uniform and personal grooming habits, employees should follow a strict dress code so they can be the face of the hotel. It can make or break the impression of your hotel.</p><p>While grooming requirements will vary between men and women, it is important that both look clean and presentable while employees are on the clock. Make sure all your employees know the dress code, and provide them with a clear outline of what is expected.</p><p>The physical appearance of the hotel staff helps to maintain the overall appearance, but the way they act also contributes to the hotel’s reputation.</p>",

The world of hospitality involves travel and tourism and so having a main language across the world that’s spoken by all employees in this field is important .Whether a person is employed by a hotel, restaurant or travel agents in a non-English speaking country, you can expect them to have a good level of English. Although many countries around the world have their own unique tourism treasures, they share a common language and this puts workers as well as travelers at ease. Remember, in the hospitality sector, no matter where you’re working, you’re likely to meet people from across the world and many of them will likely to communicate with you in English. If you’d like to brush up on your knowledge, English language courses specifically for hospitality workers can be helpful. In fact, English language knowledge is considered so important that in preparation for the World Cup in 2014, the Brazilian government encouraged its hospitality employees to sign up for free language classes offered by its Ministry of Tourism which 166,000 professionals signed up to. The courses were also tailored to those who signed up, depending on their role within the sector. The government explained that this is a big step in the personal and professional development of employees and it led to a trend in even non- sector members wanting to learn English.</p>",
